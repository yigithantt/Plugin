# Plugin
For this research, we studied the process of creating a QGIS plugin. Our goal was to develop a plugin that would compute a road's length, calculating both the real and shortest distances, and append these results to the attribute database. This assignment was successfully finished by us. We used the multiline's start and end points as a means of performing the calculations.
